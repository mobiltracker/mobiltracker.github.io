## Types of reponsive tables

Shorten
: remove unnecessary columns and keep the table concise by leaving the crucial data only

Moveable
: use swipe gestures to scroll through the whole table horizontally

Collapsed
: columns are navigated using swipe gestures, the primary column (legend) is fixed.

Transformed
: collapse table rows into separate cards.

## Guidelines

We are only using Shorten and Moveable types, because they are easy to develop.

Apply the following decisions from top to bottom:

1. Use a 3 column "shorten" table, unless it not possible.
2. Use "moveable"
